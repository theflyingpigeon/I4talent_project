# Project Name: Turnover Prediction for I4Talent

## Overview

This project aims to predict employee turnover for the company I4Talent using Python algorithms implemented in Jupyter notebooks. Employee turnover prediction is vital for businesses to anticipate and mitigate potential talent loss, allowing proactive measures to retain valuable employees.

The primary deliverable of this project is an algorithm developed in Python that accurately predicts employee turnover based on historical data and relevant features.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

-   **Jupyter Notebooks:** All code, data exploration, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation are conducted in Jupyter notebooks.

## Installation and Requirements

To run the Jupyter notebooks and utilize the turnover prediction algorithm, ensure the following requirements are met:

-   Python 3.x installed on your system.
-   Jupyter Notebook installed (you can install it via pip: `pip install jupyter`).
-   Requirement packages (you can insrall it via pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

## Usage

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    
    `git  clone  https://github.com/theflyingpigeon/I4talent_project.git`
    
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    
    `cd  I4talent_project`
    
3.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    
    `jupyter notebook`
    
4.  **Open and Run the Notebooks:**
    
    -   Explore the notebooks sequentially as they guide through data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation of the turnover prediction algorithm.

## Notebook Descriptions

-   `1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and initial exploratory data analysis.
-   `2_Feature_Engineering.ipynb`: Feature creation, transformation, and selection for model development.
-   `3_Model_Development.ipynb`: Implementation and training of machine learning algorithms for turnover prediction.
-   `4_Model_Evaluation.ipynb`: Evaluation metrics, model performance assessment, and final analysis.

## Deliverables

The primary deliverable of this project is the `3_Model_Development.ipynb` notebook, which contains the developed turnover prediction algorithm.
